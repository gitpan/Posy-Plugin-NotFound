==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::NotFound - Posy plugin to provide a custom Not Found page.


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.20'' of Posy::Plugin::NotFound.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

The purpose of this plugin is to provide the user with the ability to
present a custom "Page Not Found" page, rather than the boring plain-text
message which Posy::Core provides in the 'process_path_error' method.


==   Activation   ==

Add the plugin to the plugin list.

This plugin replaces the 'process_path_error' method, replacing its actions
with an alteration of the 'path' information so that the
$self->{config}->{not_found_entry} will be displayed instead, as if it were
a normal entry. Therefore the actions list may have to be rearranged so that
'set_config' is called before 'process_path_error'.


==   Configuration   ==

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash, which, in
the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config" file in the
config directory.

``not_found_entry''
The relative path of the entry file to use for a Not Found page. This is
expected to be somewhere under the data directory, and will be treated like
a normal entry, except that it is only shown when there is a path-parsing
error (that is, when a page is not found).

For example:

    not_found_entry: errorpages/404.html

Those using the Posy::Plugin::Categories plugin may wish also to set the
'categories_hide' value, so that one can place the custom Not Found page
into a directory which won't be displayed in the category_tree or
breadcrumbs provided by the Posy::Plugin::Categories plugin.


==== REQUIRES ====
